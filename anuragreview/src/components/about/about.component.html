                                I attend daily client calls with the team to demonstrate completed tasks,
                                gather feedback, and note down any changes required. After the
                                meeting, I prepare the meeting notes and share them with the project
                                manager, who then forwards them to both the client and our team.
                                Once if we receive feedback, we apply the necessary changes to the
                                application.

                                and work closely with the QA team for testing. If the QA team provides a
                                green sign-off for the application, we deploy it to the client’s staging
                                environment. After the client’s QA team successfully completes their
                                testing, we deploy the application to the production environment.
                                The client requested the SQL script file and an application deployment
                                process document.

                                data like city and zip codes.

                                For new tasks or feature requirements, we create a task list, break down
                                the tasks with an estimated time of arrival (ETA), and discuss the ETA
                                with the project manager.

                                Before attending the client call, we also prepare an agenda, outlining
                                what we need to demonstrate and discuss, as well as any questions to
                                ask the client.
